A&nbsp;mentor&nbsp;may share with a mentee (or protege) information about his or her own career path, as well as provide guidance, motivation, emotional support, and role modeling. A&nbsp;mentor&nbsp;may help with exploring careers, setting goals, developing contacts, and identifying resources.</h2>\n<h3>A good mentor possesses the following qualities:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"3\">\n<h3>Willingness to share skills, knowledge, and expertise. ...</h3>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"3\">\n<h3>Demonstrates a positive attitude and acts as a positive role model. ...</h3>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"3\">\n<h3>Takes a personal interest in the mentoring relationship. ...</h3>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"3\">\n<h3>Exhibits enthusiasm in the field. ...</h3>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"3\">\n<h3>Values ongoing learning and growth in the field.</h3>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Benefits of having a mentor:&nbsp;</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<h3>Advice:&nbsp;The biggest benefit of having a mentor is&nbsp;having someone you can ask questions&nbsp;and get advice from. Mentors can share a wealth of wisdom and insight on best practices in the work place, protocols and appropriate behaviours.</h3>\n</li><li>\n<h3>Networking: Forming a relationship with a mentor&nbsp;opens doors to other groups.&nbsp;It will give you the opportunity to get personal introductions to your mentor&rsquo;s contacts which may have taken your mentor years to establish.</h3>\n</li><li>\n<h3>Encouragement: You could describe a mentor as a&nbsp;professional cheerleader for your career.&nbsp;It is likely that your mentor has experienced similar successes and challenges that you will encounter at the start of your career. By sharing how they overcame their challenges, mentors can&nbsp;encourage you to reach the finish line&nbsp;and to keep pursuing your goals.</h3>\n</li><li>\n<h3>Perspective:&nbsp;&nbsp;Through their diverse experiences,&nbsp;mentors may offer a perspective and vision&nbsp;that is different to your own.&nbsp; They will ask questions that may not occur to you, but are as critically important for solving a problem or planning your career.</h3>\n</li><li>\n<h3>Reduced feelings of isolation:&nbsp;Having someone outside of your direct working environment that you can ask questions, bounce ideas with and confide in, will help to create&nbsp;a sense of peer partnership&nbsp;that may not always be available in your workplace.</h3>\n</li><li>\n<h3>Accountability:&nbsp;A good mentor will provide you with honest feedback and&nbsp;hold you accountable to your career goals.</h3>\n</li><li>\n<h3>Career planning:&nbsp;&nbsp;As a mentee, you can sit down with your mentor to set long term goals and&nbsp;strategically plan out the next steps&nbsp;to reach your career objectives.</h3>\n</li><li>\n<h3>Confidence and talent development:&nbsp;&nbsp;A mentor who has expertise in your field will be able to&nbsp;identify your strengths and talents and offer suggestions on how you can further develop them&nbsp;and grow professionally.
