A sense of God&rsquo;s calling is about commitment to loving God and loving neighbor in whatever we do every day (Matt. 22:36-39).&nbsp; This is really the underlying mission in the world for all of us, to love God and to love our neighbor as ourselves; a call to loving action. It is our job is simply to look around us with anticipation and expectancy and ask God to plug us into his mission all around us, whatever that means, and however that looks in our particular situation; to begin with loving prayerful action in response to what we see around us. Our mission relates to all parts of our lives, including the seemingly small things we do every day.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></h3>\n<h3><b>This kind of calling from God is accompanied by a sense of joy. If we&rsquo;re committed to being part of God&rsquo;s mission in the world, as individuals and as a community, God places a deep sense of desire, joy and call on our hearts that connect us with </b><b><i>his mission that is going on all around us in the world every day already</i></b><b>. At the same time, we have to be patient with God's timing, and prayerfully&nbsp;discern what&nbsp;personal aspirations are&nbsp;realistic.</b></h3>\n<h3><b>It's up to us to look for our calling every day like a treasure, with anticipation and prayerful expectancy, and to respond to what we see around us through loving action.</b></h3>\n<h3><b><i>Calling</i></b><b> - A strong urge towards a particular way of life or career; a vocation.
