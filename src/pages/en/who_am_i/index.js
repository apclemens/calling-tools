<h2>One way to understand ourselves and how we interact with work is to explore our family system, and recognize how each family member has influenced us in life. It&rsquo;s also important to acknowledge our own cultural approaches, and what our particular culture says about the value we place on our family of origin.</h2>
<h3>To explore your family of origin&rsquo;s values and attitudes to work, levels of job satisfaction, what career success looks like, and gender issues, draw a family tree of careers, jobs or education of your grandparents, parents and siblings. What themes and patterns do you see and how might these have affected your career values?</h3>
