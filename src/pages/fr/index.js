<h3>As followers of Jesus we all have a calling to fulfill a mission, wherever we are and in whatever we do. God&rsquo;s mission is going on all around us in this world, and as Jesus&rsquo; followers we have a unique purpose in God's overall mission in the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>
<h3>A calling from God for service of any kind isn&rsquo;t necessarily a calling to a place, or with a particular profession. A sense of God&rsquo;s calling is about commitment to loving God and loving neighbor in whatever we do every day (Matt. 22:36-39).&nbsp; This is really the underlying mission in the world for all of us, to love God and to love our neighbor as ourselves; a call to loving action. It is our job is simply to look around us with anticipation and expectancy and ask God to plug us into his mission all around us, whatever that means, and however that looks in our particular situation; to begin with loving prayerful action in response to what we see around us. Our mission relates to all parts of our lives, including the seemingly small things we do every day.&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>
<h3>This kind of calling from God is accompanied by a sense of joy. If we&rsquo;re committed to being part of God&rsquo;s mission in the world, as individuals and as a community, God places a deep sense of desire, joy and call on our hearts that connect us with <i>his mission that is going on all around us in the world every day already</i>. At the same time, we have to be patient with God's timing, and prayerfully&nbsp;discern what&nbsp;personal aspirations are&nbsp;realistic.</h3>
<h3>It's up to us to look for our calling every day like a treasure, with anticipation and prayerful expectancy, and to respond to what we see around us through loving action.</h3>

<h3><i>&ldquo;There are &lsquo;moments of decision&rsquo; every day&hellip;when you stand at a spiritual crossroads, with two ways lying before you&hellip;The one will lead to less gratitude, less kindness, less forgiveness, less honesty, or less love in the world. The other will lead to more gratitude, more kindness, more forgiveness, more honesty, or more love in the world. Your Mission, each moment, is to seek to choose the latter spiritual road, rather than the former, every time.&rdquo;&nbsp;</i></h3>

<h3><i>&ldquo;Each of us is called to be someone and to do things &ndash; it is part of human existence &ndash; and discovering these things is a life-long process of growth and change&hellip;The original meaning of &ldquo;vocation&rdquo; is work that calls us to connect our God-given gifts and passions with God&rsquo;s activity in the world. A vocation is a calling that merges our mission in life with God&rsquo;s mission on earth. As Frederick Buechner puts it, &ldquo;The place God calls you is the place where your deep gladness and the world&rsquo;s deep hunger meet.&rdquo; That intersecting point is your calling, your vocation.&nbsp; Vocation could be work that is outside your wage-earning sphere of activity&hellip;There is nothing wrong with planning a career, but God usually has deeper and larger plans than we can imagine&hellip;We are on a journey in which God gives us constantly evolving options, depending upon our choices and the choices of others.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</i></h3>
