Finding a <i>career</i> (where you get paid for what you do) that fulfills your passions, talents and the needs of the world is like icing on the cake!&nbsp;</h1>\n<h3>As followers of Jesus we all have a calling to fulfill a mission, wherever we are and in whatever we do. God&rsquo;s mission is going on all around us in this world, and as Jesus&rsquo; followers we have a unique purpose in God's overall mission in the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>\n<h3>A calling from God for service of any kind isn&rsquo;t necessarily a calling to a place, or with a particular profession. A sense of God&rsquo;s calling is about commitment to loving God and loving neighbor in whatever we do every day (Matt. 22:36-39).&nbsp; This is really the underlying mission in the world for all of us, to love God and to love our neighbor as ourselves; a call to loving action. It is our job is simply to look around us with anticipation and expectancy and ask God to plug us into his mission all around us, whatever that means, and however that looks in our particular situation; to begin with loving prayerful action in response to what we see around us. Our mission relates to all parts of our lives, including the seemingly small things we do every day.&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>\n<h3>This kind of calling from God is accompanied by a sense of joy. If we&rsquo;re committed to being part of God&rsquo;s mission in the world, as individuals and as a community, God places a deep sense of desire, joy and call on our hearts that connect us with <i>his mission that is going on all around us in the world every day already</i>. At the same time, we have to be patient with God's timing, and prayerfully&nbsp;discern what&nbsp;personal aspirations are&nbsp;realistic.</h3>\n<h3>It's up to us to look for our calling every day like a treasure, with anticipation and prayerful expectancy, and to respond to what we see around us through loving action.</h3>\n<h3><i>Calling</i> - A strong urge towards a particular way of life or career; a vocation. A profession or occupation.</h3>\n<h3><i>Mission</i> &ndash; A continuing task or responsibility that one is destined or fitted to do or specially called upon to undertake.</h3>\n<h3><i>Vocation</i> - A strong feeling of suitability for a particular career or occupation. A person&rsquo;s employment or main occupation especially regarded as worthy and requiring dedication. Trade or profession.</h3>\n<h3><i>Career</i> - An occupation undertaken for a significant period of a person's life and with opportunities for progress. Working permanently in or committed to a particular profession.</h3>\n<p style={{textAlign: \"center\"}}><span style={{fontWeight: 400}}>*************************************</span></p>\n<h3><i>&ldquo;There are &lsquo;moments of decision&rsquo; every day&hellip;when you stand at a spiritual crossroads, with two ways lying before you&hellip;The one will lead to less gratitude, less kindness, less forgiveness, less honesty, or less love in the world.
