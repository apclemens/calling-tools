<h3><b><i>&ldquo;Get to know yourself thoroughly. Inquire into every aspect of your nature and personality. Even if you know yourself well, find ways to observe your past and present from new viewpoints, especially those that provide tangible, realistic, and practical clues about the best fit between you and the working world...Your [ideal] work fully expresses all aspects of your nature. It fits your innate talents perfectly. It expresses your temperament and personality fully, even those parts that you do not see as positive. It provides the rewards that matter to you. It fulfills your goals. It occurs in an environment that is suitable and appropriate to who you are.&rdquo;&nbsp;</i></b></h3>

<h2><b>One way to understand ourselves and how we interact with work is to explore our family system, and recognize how each family member has influenced us in life. It&rsquo;s also important to acknowledge our own cultural approaches, and what our particular culture says about the value we place on our family of origin.</b></h2>
<h3><b>To explore your family of origin&rsquo;s values and attitudes to work, levels of job satisfaction, what career success looks like, and gender issues, draw a family tree of careers, jobs or education of your grandparents, parents and siblings.
