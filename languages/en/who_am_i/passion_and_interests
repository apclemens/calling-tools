<h3><b><i>&ldquo;</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are trying to discern your vocation, the right question is not what am I good at? It&rsquo;s the harder questions: What am I motivated to do? What activity do I love so much that I&rsquo;m going to keep getting better at it for the next many decades? What do I desire so much that it capture me at the depth of my being? &hellip;The crucial terrain to be explored in any vocation search is the terrain of your heart and soul, your long-term motivation. Knowledge is plentiful; motivation is scarce.&rdquo;</span></h3>
